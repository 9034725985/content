# Content for Fedora Developer Portal
Contains files with content in Markdown syntax.

[Fedora Developer Portal project page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Websites/Developer)

## How To Create a Content
The website would consist of several sections. Each section would contain a set of pages.
Each content file must start with initial section in YAML syntax describing the title and where the file belongs.

### An Example for DevAssistant
Every file except the main page would start with:
```yaml
---
title: Some Title      # This title is shown in menus
page: devassistant     # This is an ID of your content (select value from the list below)
---
```
The main page would contain:
```yaml
---
title: DevAssistant    # This title is shown in menus
page: devassistant     # This is an ID of your content (select value from the list below)
section: tools         # This page would be linked from the main menu in a group called tools (select value from the list below)
---
```
