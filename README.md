# Content for Fedora Developer Portal

[Project Page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Websites/Developer) | [First Milestone](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/milestones/first%20release) | [How To Contribute](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## How To Create a Content
The website would consist of several sections. Each section would contain a set of pages.
Each content file must start with initial section in YAML syntax describing the title and where the file belongs.

### An Example for DevAssistant
Every file except the main page would start with:
```yaml
---
title: Some Title      # This title is shown in menus
page: devassistant     # This is an ID of your content (select value from the list below)
order: 1
---

`order` attribute is optional, but it is highly recommended to include. Our templates sort navigation items according to this value
(smaller value means they come first).

```
The main page would contain:
```yaml
---
title: DevAssistant    # This title is shown in menus
page: devassistant     # This is an ID of your content (select value from the list below)
section: tools         # This page would be linked from the main menu in a group called tools (select value from the list below)
---
```


### Section and Page Names
First level is a section id. Second level is a page id.
