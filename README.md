# Content for Fedora Developer Portal

[Project Page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Websites/Developer) | [First Milestone](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/milestones/first%20release) | [How To Contribute](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## How To Create a Content
1. Read our [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) about writing a content
2. Learn about [markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
3. [Create new](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) or modify existing files with content

## How To Test Your Changes
You can easily review the markdown formatting directly on Github but if you want to see how your changes look in context of the whole website, you might want to take a look at the [Website repository](https://github.com/developer-portal/website) and run a local instance of the portal.

### Structure
The website would consist of several sections. Each section would contain a set of pages.
Each content file must start with initial section in YAML syntax describing the title and where the file belongs.

#### An Example for DevAssistant
Every file except the main page would start with:
```yaml
---
title: Some Title      # This title is shown in menus
page: devassistant     # This is an ID of your content (select value from the list below)
order: 1               # Optional - order in menu
---
```
The main page would contain:
```yaml
---
title: DevAssistant    # This title is shown in menus
page: devassistant     # This is an ID of your content (select value from the list below)
section: tools         # This page would be linked from the main menu in a group called tools (select value from the list below)
---
```

#### Section and Page Names
First level is a section id. Second level is a page id.
