# content
Content for the Fedora Developer Portal in Markdown syntax.

## How To Create a Content
The website would consist of several sections. Each section would contain a set of pages.
**Each content file** must start with initial section in YAML syntax describing the title and where the file belongs. An example for DevAssistant:
```yaml
---
title: DevAssistant
page: devassistant
---
```
Each project might have several pages. **One** of them would be the **main page**, starting with:
```yaml
---
title: DevAssistant
page: devassistant
section: tools
---
```
