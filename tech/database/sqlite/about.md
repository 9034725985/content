# SQLite Installation

To install basic SQLite (if it is not already), simply type:

    $ sudo dnf install sqlite

This package provides the basic library and the command-line client `sqlite`. In
order to access SQLite databases from various programming languages (C, Tcl,
Java), the language bindings need to be installed separately:

    $ sudo dnf install sqlite-devel sqlite-tcl sqlite-jdbc

## Graphical clients

The `sqlite` client shipped with the basic database engine is command line (CLI)
based. If you prefer an application with graphical user interface (GUI), install
the `sqliteman` package:

    $ sudo dnf install sqliteman

# Working with SQLite

SQLite stores it's data in single database file. To open such file (which will
be created if necessary), pass it's name as CLI argument to `sqlite3`
executable:

    $ sqlite3 hello-world.db

After executing this command, you will be greeted with a SQLite prompt and can
now insert the SQL commands to execute.

If you prefer using GUI, the [Sqliteman][sqliteman] application enables you to
construct your SQL queries using visual tool.

If you are new to SQL databases and like to know more, you can visit a
[W3CSchools SQL tutorial][sql-tut], which should give you a nice head start.

# Getting help with SQLite

As is the custom in Fedora, SQLite documentation is available in `-doc`
sub-package. Additionally, the JavaDoc documentation for JDBC bindings is
available as well:

    $ sudo dnf install sqlite-doc sqlite-jdbc-javadoc

After the packages are installed, the actual documentation in HTML format is
located within `/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE` directory. For example, to view
documentation for SQLite itself, you can open this URL in your browser:

    file:///usr/share/doc/sqlite-doc/index.html

If the documentation does not contain what you are looking for, you can visit
the project [homepage][sqlite-home], or ask in the [mailing lists][sqlite-lists].
